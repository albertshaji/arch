## "Arch Linux" on "ThinkPad x220" with "Minimalist Programs"

This is a collection of my custom configuration files for command-line Linux programs. These are the files that mainly fit into `~/.config` or user home directory. The active path of each file is mentioned as a comment in its first line. This comment helps `config.sh` (from the scripts reop) to deploy these files during a fresh arch installation or backup before installation.

Some config files which you may find uncommon, and would like to know its role? Some of them may be specific to "Arch Linux" on "ThinkPad x220".

- **touchpad**, Enabling the touchpad scroll feature.
